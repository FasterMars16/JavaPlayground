This repository hosts a library of cool programs written in Java, serving as an educational repository for Java code. We aim to write programs and store it as a reference for later.

This is a sandbox for all different types of programs, all the way from arrays, to different sorting algorithms, we will slowly be building on the codebase as time goes by. 

## Sections / Folders
The repository is split into different parts (sections) for the sake of organization, the programs have been split into these categories.

- Character Manipulation
- Array programs
- Sorting Algorithms
- Inheritance between packages
- Package Build tests
- Sandbox for random programs
